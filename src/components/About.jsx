                    Experience the first-ever open world Star Wars™ game, set
                    between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of
                    the Jedi. Explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both
                    iconic and new. Risk it all as Kay Vess, a scoundrel seeking
                    freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her
                    companion Nix. Fight, steal, and outwit your way through the
                    galaxy’s crime syndicates as you join the galaxy’s most
                    wanted.
                </p>
                <p className="conclusion">
                    If you’re willing to take the risk, the galaxy is full of
                    opportunity.
